      <img src="{% static 'assets/htc/Abelia Table.png' %}" alt="#"> 
      <div class="m-1 p-1 text-justify"> 
      <P>Known for its vibrant foliage and long bloom times, the Abelia genus consists of about 30 species of both deciduous and
        evergreen shrubs. There has been much discussion about the Abelia genus itself, since modern DNA testing has proved 
        that some previously recognized members of the genus were substantially different.Various horticultural experts recognize
        different nomenclature structures, either reducing the size of the Abelia genus or reclassifying these species as members
        of the Linnea genus.
        </p>

     <p>For shrubs commonly known as abelia, there are several common identifiers. These shrubs produce pointed, oval-shaped leaves that are often yellow or green with pink, orange, bronze, or burgundy details. Some are multi-colored or variegated and even
        change color as the seasons change. Their flowers are tubular and are often seen in white, pink, or yellow. Unlike many flowering
        plants, abelia shrubs have a long blooming season that extends from spring until fall.
      </P>   
      <h3 class="my-2"><b>Light</b></h3>
      <p>Abelia can be grown in both full sun and partial shade. However, planting them in an area with full sun will encourage more
         vibrant foliage colors and a healthy bloom. Plants grown in areas with intense summer heat will benefit from some afternoon shade.
  </p>
  <h3 class="my-2"><b></b>Soil</h3>
      <p>Although abelia plants thrive in fertile, well-draining, and moist soil, they are tolerant of different soil conditions. Amending
         the soil with compost before planting is recommended, as these plants do best in soil that is rich in organic matter. Soil pH
         levels should be slightly acidic for optimal growth.
  </p>
  <h3 class="my-2"><b>Water</b></h3>
      <p>These low-maintenance plants are drought tolerant once established. However, they do best when provided with regular watering.
         Especially during the hotter summer months, you should plan to water abelias once or twice a week to keep them vibrant and healthy.
         Allow the soil to begin drying before watering again. Watering deeply and infrequently is better for abelias than watering lightly
         and regularly.
  </p>    
  <h3 class="my-2"><b>Temperature and Humidity</b></h3>
      <p>Abelia plants can be grown in a wide range of climates, from USDA hardiness zones 4 to 11. The preferred growing zones depend on
         the specific needs of each variety.
  </p>
  <h3 class="my-2"><b>Fertilizer</b></h3>
      <p>Abelia shrubs benefit from soil that is rich in organic matter. Add compost yearly to provide needed nutrients and to support proper
         soil drainage. Additionally, providing the plant with a slow-release shrub fertilizer in the early spring will give abelias the boost
         they need for another year of growth.
      </p>
      <h3 class="my-2"><b>Pruning</b></h3>
      <p>Occasional pruning will help keep abelia shrubs looking clean and growing strong. It is best to prune in late winter or early spring to avoid pruning
         off new growth or flower buds. Remove any damaged or dead branches and prune the plant to your desired shape. Take no more than about
         one-third of the shrub. Certain varieties produce long, thin shoots from the trunk or branches that can be removed for a cleaner appearance.
         Other varieties bloom on old wood, making it best to prune after flowering.
      </p> 
      <h3 class="my-2"><b>Propagating Abelia</b></h3>
      <p>Propagating abelia can be done through cuttings, both hardwood and softwood. Though hardwood cuttings are often hardier than softwood,
         they do not root as easily as softwood cuttings. Softwood cuttings are taken in the spring while hardwood cuttings are taken in the fall.
         Both are cared for in the same way. To grow either option, you will need sharp snips, a small pot, well-draining, rich soil, and rooting
         hormone. Then follow these steps:
        <br><b>1.</b> Using sharp snips, cut a small branch that is around 6 inches long. Cut below a node.
         <br><b>2.</b> Remove any lower leaves.<br>
         <br><b>3.</b> Dip the cut end into root hormone, then gently plant it into well-draining, rich soil.<br>
         <br><b>4.</b> Place the pot in a warm, sunny area. Keep the soil moist.<br>
         <br><b>5.</b> Roots should form in around one to two months.<br>
